# Reading_And_Cleaning_Data_Week4
Project for reading and cleaning data - Week 4

## Course Project requirements
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Instructions
1. Download the run_analysis.R source code to your rstudio working directory.
2. Make sure that the data directory "UCI HAR Dataset" is under your working directory
3. Run the R file. This will generate a file called tidy_data.txt

## Dependencies
data.table and reshape2 packages are required for this program to run.
